T1548,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine. authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk. an adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.,Technique
T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"an adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user’s context. on linux or macos, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively. normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. however, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.",Technique
T1548.002,Bypass User Account Control,"adversaries may bypass uac mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. windows user account control (uac) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. the impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.",Technique
T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.,Technique
T1548.004,Elevated Execution with Prompt,"adversaries may leverage the authorizationexecutewithprivileges api to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials. the purpose of this api is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating. this api does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.",Technique
T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"adversaries may abuse permission configurations that allow them to gain temporarily elevated access to cloud resources. many cloud environments allow administrators to grant user or service accounts permission to request just-in-time access to roles, impersonate other accounts, pass roles onto resources and services, or otherwise gain short-term access to a set of privileges that may be distinct from their own.",Technique
T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,"adversaries can manipulate or abuse the transparency, consent, & control (tcc) service or database to grant malicious executables elevated permissions. tcc is a privacy & security macos control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by tcc, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or full disk access (fda).",Technique
T1134,Access Token Manipulation,"adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. a user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. when this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.",Technique
T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,"adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. for example, an adversary can duplicate an existing token using duplicatetoken or duplicatetokenex. the token can then be used with impersonateloggedonuser  to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with setthreadtoken to assign the impersonated token to a thread.",Technique
T1134.002,Create Process with Token,adversaries may create a new process with an existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. processes can be created with the token and resulting security context of another user using features such as createprocesswithtokenw and runas.,Technique
T1134.003,Make and Impersonate Token,"adversaries may make new tokens and impersonate users to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. for example, if an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using the logonuser  function. the function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use setthreadtoken to assign the token to a thread.",Technique
T1134.004,Parent PID Spoofing,"adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (ppid) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. new processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. one way of explicitly assigning the ppid of a new process is via the createprocess api call, which supports a parameter that defines the ppid to use. this functionality is used by windows features such as user account control (uac) to correctly set the ppid after a requested elevated process is spawned by system (typically via svchost.exe or consent.exe) rather than the current user context.",Technique
T1134.005,SID-History Injection,"adversaries may use sid-history injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. the windows security identifier (sid) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. sids are used by windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens. an account can hold additional sids in the sid-history active directory attribute, allowing inter-operable account migration between domains (e.g., all values in sid-history are included in access tokens).",Technique
T1531,Account Access Removal,"adversaries may interrupt availability of system and network resources by inhibiting access to accounts utilized by legitimate users. accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated (ex: changed credentials) to remove access to accounts. adversaries may also subsequently log off and/or perform a system shutdown/reboot to set malicious changes into place.",Technique
T1087,Account Discovery,"adversaries may attempt to get a listing of valid accounts, usernames, or email addresses on a system or within a compromised environment. this information can help adversaries determine which accounts exist, which can aid in follow-on behavior such as brute-forcing, spear-phishing attacks, or account takeovers (e.g., valid accounts).",Technique
T1087.001,Local Account,adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system accounts. this information can help adversaries determine which local accounts exist on a system to aid in follow-on behavior.,Technique
T1087.002,Domain Account,adversaries may attempt to get a listing of domain accounts. this information can help adversaries determine which domain accounts exist to aid in follow-on behavior such as targeting specific accounts which possess particular privileges.,Technique
T1087.003,Email Account,adversaries may attempt to get a listing of email addresses and accounts. adversaries may try to dump exchange address lists such as global address lists (gals).,Technique
T1087.004,Cloud Account,"adversaries may attempt to get a listing of cloud accounts. cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or saas application.",Technique
T1098,Account Manipulation,"adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain and/or elevate access to victim systems. account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves or modifies adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. these actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials.",Technique
T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.,Technique
T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account.,Technique
T1098.003,Additional Cloud Roles,"an adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled cloud account to maintain persistent access to a tenant. for example, adversaries may update iam policies in cloud-based environments or add a new global administrator in office 365 environments. with sufficient permissions, a compromised account can gain almost unlimited access to data and settings (including the ability to reset the passwords of other admins).",Technique
T1098.004,SSH Authorized Keys,adversaries may modify the ssh authorized_keys file to maintain persistence on a victim host. linux distributions and macos commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication process of ssh sessions for remote management. the authorized_keys file in ssh specifies the ssh keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured. this file is usually found in the user's home directory under <user-home>/.ssh/authorized_keys. users may edit the system’s ssh config file to modify the directives pubkeyauthentication and rsaauthentication to the value 'yes' to ensure public key and rsa authentication are enabled. the ssh config file is usually located under /etc/ssh/sshd_config.,Technique
T1098.005,Device Registration,"adversaries may register a device to an adversary-controlled account. devices may be registered in a multifactor authentication (mfa) system, which handles authentication to the network, or in a device management system, which handles device access and compliance.",Technique
T1098.006,Additional Container Cluster Roles,"an adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled user or service account to maintain persistent access to a container orchestration system. for example, an adversary with sufficient permissions may create a rolebinding or a clusterrolebinding to bind a role or clusterrole to a kubernetes account. where attribute-based access control (abac) is in use, an adversary with sufficient permissions may modify a kubernetes abac policy to give the target account additional permissions.",Technique
T1650,Acquire Access,"adversaries may purchase or otherwise acquire an existing access to a target system or network. a variety of online services and initial access broker networks are available to sell access to previously compromised systems. in some cases, adversary groups may form partnerships to share compromised systems with each other.",Technique
T1583,Acquire Infrastructure,"adversaries may buy, lease, rent, or obtain infrastructure that can be used during targeting. a wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations. infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web services. some infrastructure providers offer free trial periods, enabling infrastructure acquisition at limited to no cost. additionally, botnets are available for rent or purchase.",Technique
T1583.001,Domains,"adversaries may acquire domains that can be used during targeting. domain names are the human readable names used to represent one or more ip addresses. they can be purchased or, in some cases, acquired for free.",Technique
T1583.002,DNS Server,"adversaries may set up their own domain name system (dns) servers that can be used during targeting. during post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize dns traffic for various tasks, including for command and control (ex: application layer protocol). instead of hijacking existing dns servers, adversaries may opt to configure and run their own dns servers in support of operations.",Technique
T1583.003,Virtual Private Server,"adversaries may rent virtual private servers (vpss) that can be used during targeting. there exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. by utilizing a vps, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. the use of cloud infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure.",Technique
T1583.004,Server,"adversaries may buy, lease, rent, or obtain physical servers that can be used during targeting. use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. during post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, such as watering hole operations in drive-by compromise, enabling phishing operations, or facilitating command and control. instead of compromising a third-party server or renting a virtual private server, adversaries may opt to configure and run their own servers in support of operations. free trial periods of cloud servers may also be abused.",Technique
T1583.005,Botnet,"adversaries may buy, lease, or rent a network of compromised systems that can be used during targeting. a botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks. adversaries may purchase a subscription to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service. with a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale phishing or distributed denial of service (ddos).",Technique
T1583.006,Web Services,"adversaries may register for web services that can be used during targeting. a variety of popular websites exist for adversaries to register for a web-based service that can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during command and control (web service), exfiltration over web service, or phishing. using common services, such as those offered by google or twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. by utilizing a web service, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them.",Technique
T1583.007,Serverless,"adversaries may purchase and configure serverless cloud infrastructure, such as cloudflare workers, aws lambda functions, or google apps scripts, that can be used during targeting. by utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.",Technique
T1583.008,Malvertising,"adversaries may purchase online advertisements that can be abused to distribute malware to victims. ads can be purchased to plant as well as favorably position artifacts in specific locations online, such as prominently placed within search engine results. these ads may make it more difficult for users to distinguish between actual search results and advertisements. purchased ads may also target specific audiences using the advertising network’s capabilities, potentially further taking advantage of the trust inherently given to search engines and popular websites.",Technique
T1595,Active Scanning,"adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that can be used during targeting. active scans are those where the adversary probes victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance that do not involve direct interaction.",Technique
T1595.001,Scanning IP Blocks,"adversaries may scan victim ip blocks to gather information that can be used during targeting. public ip addresses may be allocated to organizations by block, or a range of sequential addresses.",Technique
T1595.002,Vulnerability Scanning,adversaries may scan victims for vulnerabilities that can be used during targeting. vulnerability scans typically check if the configuration of a target host/application (ex: software and version) potentially aligns with the target of a specific exploit the adversary may seek to use.,Technique
T1595.003,Wordlist Scanning,"adversaries may iteratively probe infrastructure using brute-forcing and crawling techniques. while this technique employs similar methods to brute force, its goal is the identification of content and infrastructure rather than the discovery of valid credentials. wordlists used in these scans may contain generic, commonly used names and file extensions or terms specific to a particular software. adversaries may also create custom, target-specific wordlists using data gathered from other reconnaissance techniques (ex: gather victim org information, or search victim-owned websites).",Technique
T1557,Adversary-in-the-Middle,"adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (aitm) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as network sniffing, transmitted data manipulation, or replay attacks (exploitation for credential access). by abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. arp, dns, llmnr, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.",Technique
T1557.001,LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay,"by responding to llmnr/nbt-ns network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system. this activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials.",Technique
T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,adversaries may poison address resolution protocol (arp) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. this activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as network sniffing or transmitted data manipulation.,Technique
T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,"adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems by spoofing dynamic host configuration protocol (dhcp) traffic and acting as a malicious dhcp server on the victim network. by achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (aitm) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. this may also enable follow-on behaviors such as network sniffing or transmitted data manipulation.",Technique
T1557.004,Evil Twin,"adversaries may host seemingly genuine wi-fi access points to deceive users into connecting to malicious networks as a way of supporting follow-on behaviors such as network sniffing, transmitted data manipulation, or input capture.",Technique
T1071,Application Layer Protocol,"adversaries may communicate using osi application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.",Technique
T1071.001,Web Protocols,"adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.",Technique
T1071.002,File Transfer Protocols,"adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with transferring files to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.",Technique
T1071.003,Mail Protocols,"adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with electronic mail delivery to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.",Technique
T1071.004,DNS,"adversaries may communicate using the domain name system (dns) application layer protocol to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.",Technique
T1071.005,Publish/Subscribe Protocols,"adversaries may communicate using publish/subscribe (pub/sub) application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.",Technique
T1010,Application Window Discovery,"adversaries may attempt to get a listing of open application windows. window listings could convey information about how the system is used. for example, information about application windows could be used identify potential data to collect as well as identifying security tooling (security software discovery) to evade.",Technique
T1560,Archive Collected Data,an adversary may compress and/or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration. compressing the data can help to obfuscate the collected data and minimize the amount of data sent over the network. encryption can be used to hide information that is being exfiltrated from detection or make exfiltration less conspicuous upon inspection by a defender.,Technique
T1560.001,Archive via Utility,"adversaries may use utilities to compress and/or encrypt collected data prior to exfiltration. many utilities include functionalities to compress, encrypt, or otherwise package data into a format that is easier/more secure to transport.",Technique
T1560.002,Archive via Library,"an adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration using 3rd party libraries. many libraries exist that can archive data, including python rarfile, libzip, and zlib. most libraries include functionality to encrypt and/or compress data.",Technique
T1560.003,Archive via Custom Method,"an adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration using a custom method. adversaries may choose to use custom archival methods, such as encryption with xor or stream ciphers implemented with no external library or utility references. custom implementations of well-known compression algorithms have also been used.",Technique
T1123,Audio Capture,"an adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., microphones and webcams) or applications (e.g., voice and video call services) to capture audio recordings for the purpose of listening into sensitive conversations to gather information.",Technique
T1119,Automated Collection,"once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. methods for performing this technique could include use of a command and scripting interpreter to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals.",Technique
T1020,Automated Exfiltration,"adversaries may exfiltrate data, such as sensitive documents, through the use of automated processing after being gathered during collection.",Technique
T1020.001,Traffic Duplication,"adversaries may leverage traffic mirroring in order to automate data exfiltration over compromised infrastructure. traffic mirroring is a native feature for some devices, often used for network analysis. for example, devices may be configured to forward network traffic to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device.",Technique
T1197,BITS Jobs,"adversaries may abuse bits jobs to persistently execute code and perform various background tasks. windows background intelligent transfer service (bits) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through component object model (com). bits is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. file transfer tasks are implemented as bits jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.",Technique
T1547,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution,"adversaries may configure system settings to automatically execute a program during system boot or logon to maintain persistence or gain higher-level privileges on compromised systems. operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running a program on system boot or account logon. these mechanisms may include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information, such as the windows registry. an adversary may achieve the same goal by modifying or extending features of the kernel.",Technique
T1547.001,Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder,adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a registry run key. adding an entry to the 'run keys' in the registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. these programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.,Technique
T1547.002,Authentication Package,adversaries may abuse authentication packages to execute dlls when the system boots. windows authentication package dlls are loaded by the local security authority (lsa) process at system start. they provide support for multiple logon processes and multiple security protocols to the operating system.,Technique
T1547.003,Time Providers,adversaries may abuse time providers to execute dlls when the system boots. the windows time service (w32time) enables time synchronization across and within domains. w32time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.,Technique
T1547.004,Winlogon Helper DLL,adversaries may abuse features of winlogon to execute dlls and/or executables when a user logs in. winlogon.exe is a windows component responsible for actions at logon/logoff as well as the secure attention sequence (sas) triggered by ctrl-alt-delete. registry entries in hklm\software[\wow6432node\]\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\winlogon\ and hkcu\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\winlogon\ are used to manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support winlogon.,Technique
T1547.005,Security Support Provider,"adversaries may abuse security support providers (ssps) to execute dlls when the system boots. windows ssp dlls are loaded into the local security authority (lsa) process at system start. once loaded into the lsa, ssp dlls have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in windows, such as any logged-on user's domain password or smart card pins.",Technique
T1547.006,Kernel Modules and Extensions,"adversaries may modify the kernel to automatically execute programs on system boot. loadable kernel modules (lkms) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. they extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. for example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system.",Technique
T1547.007,Re-opened Applications,"adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in. when a user logs out or restarts via the macos graphical user interface (gui), a prompt is provided to the user with a checkbox to 'reopen windows when logging back in'. when selected, all applications currently open are added to a property list file named com.apple.loginwindow.[uuid].plist within the ~/library/preferences/byhost directory. applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the user’s next logon.",Technique
T1547.008,LSASS Driver,"adversaries may modify or add lsass drivers to obtain persistence on compromised systems. the windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. the local security authority (lsa) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. the lsa includes multiple dynamic link libraries (dlls) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the lsa subsystem service (lsass) lsass.exe process.",Technique
T1547.009,Shortcut Modification,adversaries may create or modify shortcuts that can execute a program during system boot or user login. shortcuts or symbolic links are used to reference other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.,Technique
T1547.010,Port Monitors,"adversaries may use port monitors to run an adversary supplied dll during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation. a port monitor can be set through the addmonitor api call to set a dll to be loaded at startup. this dll can be located in c:\windows\system32 and will be loaded and run by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, under system level permissions on boot.",Technique
T1547.012,Print Processors,"adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious dlls during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation. print processors are dlls that are loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, during boot.",Technique
T1547.013,XDG Autostart Entries,"adversaries may add or modify xdg autostart entries to execute malicious programs or commands when a user’s desktop environment is loaded at login. xdg autostart entries are available for any xdg-compliant linux system. xdg autostart entries use desktop entry files (.desktop) to configure the user’s desktop environment upon user login. these configuration files determine what applications launch upon user login, define associated applications to open specific file types, and define applications used to open removable media.",Technique
T1547.014,Active Setup,adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a registry key to the active setup of the local machine. active setup is a windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in. the value stored in the registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer. these programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.,Technique
T1547.015,Login Items,"adversaries may add login items to execute upon user login to gain persistence or escalate privileges. login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in. login items can be added via a shared file list or service management framework. shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such as applescript, whereas the service management framework uses the api call smloginitemsetenabled.",Technique
T1037,Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts,"adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence. initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server. these scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.",Technique
T1037.001,Logon Script (Windows),adversaries may use windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. this is done via adding a path to a script to the hkcu\environment\userinitmprlogonscript registry key.,Technique
T1037.002,Login Hook,adversaries may use a login hook to establish persistence executed upon user logon. a login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user logon. the plist file is located in the /library/preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist file and can be modified using the defaults command-line utility. this behavior is the same for logout hooks where a script can be executed upon user logout. all hooks require administrator permissions to modify or create hooks.,Technique
T1037.003,Network Logon Script,"adversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. network logon scripts can be assigned using active directory or group policy objects. these logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to. depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems.",Technique
T1037.004,RC Scripts,adversaries may establish persistence by modifying rc scripts which are executed during a unix-like system’s startup. these files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. rc scripts require root privileges to modify.,Technique
T1037.005,Startup Items,adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence. startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.,Technique
T1176,Browser Extensions,adversaries may abuse internet browser extensions to establish persistent access to victim systems. browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of internet browsers. they can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.,Technique
T1217,Browser Information Discovery,"adversaries may enumerate information about browsers to learn more about compromised environments. data saved by browsers (such as bookmarks, accounts, and browsing history) may reveal a variety of personal information about users (e.g., banking sites, relationships/interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.",Technique
T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,"adversaries may take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors, and intercept information as part of various browser session hijacking techniques.",Technique
T1110,Brute Force,"adversaries may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained. without knowledge of the password for an account or set of accounts, an adversary may systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. brute forcing passwords can take place via interaction with a service that will check the validity of those credentials or offline against previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes.",Technique
T1110.001,Password Guessing,"adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts. without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. an adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords. password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.",Technique
T1110.002,Password Cracking,"adversaries may use password cracking to attempt to recover usable credentials, such as plaintext passwords, when credential material such as password hashes are obtained. os credential dumping can be used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when pass the hash is not an option. further, adversaries may leverage data from configuration repository in order to obtain hashed credentials for network devices.",Technique
T1110.003,Password Spraying,"adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials. password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.",Technique

T1491.001,Internal Defacement,"an adversary may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users, thus discrediting the integrity of the systems. this may take the form of modifications to internal websites, or directly to user systems with the replacement of the desktop wallpaper. disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of internal defacement in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages. since internally defacing systems exposes an adversary's presence, it often takes place after other intrusion goals have been accomplished.",Technique
T1491.002,External Defacement,"an adversary may deface systems external to an organization in an attempt to deliver messaging, intimidate, or otherwise mislead an organization or users. external defacement may ultimately cause users to distrust the systems and to question/discredit the system’s integrity. externally-facing websites are a common victim of defacement; often targeted by adversary and hacktivist groups in order to push a political message or spread propaganda. external defacement may be used as a catalyst to trigger events, or as a response to actions taken by an organization or government. similarly, website defacement may also be used as setup, or a precursor, for future attacks such as drive-by compromise.",Technique
T1140,Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information,adversaries may use obfuscated files or information to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. they may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system.,Technique
T1610,Deploy Container,"adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses. in some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download malware. in others, an adversary may deploy a new container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within the environment. in kubernetes environments, an adversary may attempt to deploy a privileged or vulnerable container into a specific node in order to escape to host and access other containers running on the node.",Technique
T1587,Develop Capabilities,"adversaries may build capabilities that can be used during targeting. rather than purchasing, freely downloading, or stealing capabilities, adversaries may develop their own capabilities in-house. this is the process of identifying development requirements and building solutions such as malware, exploits, and self-signed certificates. adversaries may develop capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.",Technique
T1587.001,Malware,"adversaries may develop malware and malware components that can be used during targeting. building malicious software can include the development of payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors (including backdoored images), packers, c2 protocols, and the creation of infected removable media. adversaries may develop malware to support their operations, creating a means for maintaining control of remote machines, evading defenses, and executing post-compromise behaviors.",Technique
T1587.002,Code Signing Certificates,adversaries may create self-signed code signing certificates that can be used during targeting. code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted. code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with. users and/or security tools may trust a signed piece of code more than an unsigned piece of code even if they don't know who issued the certificate or who the author is.,Technique
T1587.003,Digital Certificates,"adversaries may create self-signed ssl/tls certificates that can be used during targeting. ssl/tls certificates are designed to instill trust. they include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. if the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner. in the case of self-signing, digital certificates will lack the element of trust associated with the signature of a third-party certificate authority (ca).",Technique
T1587.004,Exploits,"adversaries may develop exploits that can be used during targeting. an exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software. rather than finding/modifying exploits from online or purchasing them from exploit vendors, an adversary may develop their own exploits. adversaries may use information acquired via vulnerabilities to focus exploit development efforts. as part of the exploit development process, adversaries may uncover exploitable vulnerabilities through methods such as fuzzing and patch analysis.",Technique
T1652,Device Driver Discovery,"adversaries may attempt to enumerate local device drivers on a victim host. information about device drivers may highlight various insights that shape follow-on behaviors, such as the function/purpose of the host, present security tools (i.e. security software discovery) or other defenses (e.g., virtualization/sandbox evasion), as well as potential exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., exploitation for privilege escalation).",Technique
T1006,Direct Volume Access,adversaries may directly access a volume to bypass file access controls and file system monitoring. windows allows programs to have direct access to logical volumes. programs with direct access may read and write files directly from the drive by analyzing file system data structures. this technique may bypass windows file access controls as well as file system monitoring tools.,Technique
T1561,Disk Wipe,"adversaries may wipe or corrupt raw disk data on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. with direct write access to a disk, adversaries may attempt to overwrite portions of disk data. adversaries may opt to wipe arbitrary portions of disk data and/or wipe disk structures like the master boot record (mbr). a complete wipe of all disk sectors may be attempted.",Technique
T1561.001,Disk Content Wipe,adversaries may erase the contents of storage devices on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.,Technique
T1561.002,Disk Structure Wipe,adversaries may corrupt or wipe the disk data structures on a hard drive necessary to boot a system; targeting specific critical systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.,Technique
T1484,Domain or Tenant Policy Modification,"adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain or identity tenant to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges in centrally managed environments. such services provide a centralized means of managing identity resources such as devices and accounts, and often include configuration settings that may apply between domains or tenants such as trust relationships, identity syncing, or identity federation.",Technique
T1484.001,Group Policy Modification,"adversaries may modify group policy objects (gpos) to subvert the intended discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the intention of escalating privileges on the domain. group policy allows for centralized management of user and computer settings in active directory (ad). gpos are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within a predictable network path \<domain>\sysvol\<domain>\policies\.",Technique
T1484.002,Trust Modification,"adversaries may add new domain trusts, modify the properties of existing domain trusts, or otherwise change the configuration of trust relationships between domains and tenants to evade defenses and/or elevate privileges. trust details, such as whether or not user identities are federated, allow authentication and authorization properties to apply between domains or tenants for the purpose of accessing shared resources. these trust objects may include accounts, credentials, and other authentication material applied to servers, tokens, and domains.",Technique
T1482,Domain Trust Discovery,"adversaries may attempt to gather information on domain trust relationships that may be used to identify lateral movement opportunities in windows multi-domain/forest environments. domain trusts provide a mechanism for a domain to allow access to resources based on the authentication procedures of another domain. domain trusts allow the users of the trusted domain to access resources in the trusting domain. the information discovered may help the adversary conduct sid-history injection, pass the ticket, and kerberoasting. domain trusts can be enumerated using the dsenumeratedomaintrusts() win32 api call, .net methods, and ldap. the windows utility nltest is known to be used by adversaries to enumerate domain trusts.",Technique
T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. with this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring application access token.",Technique
T1568,Dynamic Resolution,"adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure to evade common detections and remediations. this may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications. these calculations can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, ip address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.",Technique
T1568.001,Fast Flux DNS,"adversaries may use fast flux dns to hide a command and control channel behind an array of rapidly changing ip addresses linked to a single domain resolution. this technique uses a fully qualified domain name, with multiple ip addresses assigned to it which are swapped with high frequency, using a combination of round robin ip addressing and short time-to-live (ttl) for a dns resource record.",Technique
T1568.002,Domain Generation Algorithms,"adversaries may make use of domain generation algorithms (dgas) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static ip addresses or domains. this has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.",Technique
T1568.003,DNS Calculation,"adversaries may perform calculations on addresses returned in dns results to determine which port and ip address to use for command and control, rather than relying on a predetermined port number or the actual returned ip address. a ip and/or port number calculation can be used to bypass egress filtering on a c2 channel.",Technique
T1114,Email Collection,"adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information. emails may contain sensitive data, including trade secrets or personal information, that can prove valuable to adversaries. emails may also contain details of ongoing incident response operations, which may allow adversaries to adjust their techniques in order to maintain persistence or evade defenses. adversaries can collect or forward email from mail servers or clients.",Technique
T1114.001,Local Email Collection,"adversaries may target user email on local systems to collect sensitive information. files containing email data can be acquired from a user’s local system, such as outlook storage or cache files.",Technique
T1114.002,Remote Email Collection,"adversaries may target an exchange server, office 365, or google workspace to collect sensitive information. adversaries may leverage a user's credentials and interact directly with the exchange server to acquire information from within a network. adversaries may also access externally facing exchange services, office 365, or google workspace to access email using credentials or access tokens. tools such as mailsniper can be used to automate searches for specific keywords.",Technique
T1114.003,Email Forwarding Rule,"adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information. adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim’s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations. furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators. most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. these rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.",Technique
T1573,Encrypted Channel,"adversaries may employ an encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.",Technique
T1573.001,Symmetric Cryptography,"adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for plaintext encryption and ciphertext decryption. common symmetric encryption algorithms include aes, des, 3des, blowfish, and rc4.",Technique
T1573.002,Asymmetric Cryptography,"adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. this ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. common public key encryption algorithms include rsa and elgamal.",Technique
T1499,Endpoint Denial of Service,"adversaries may perform endpoint denial of service (dos) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. endpoint dos can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. example services include websites, email services, dns, and web-based applications. adversaries have been observed conducting dos attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.",Technique
T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,adversaries may launch a denial of service (dos) attack targeting an endpoint's operating system (os). a system's os is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. these attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an os self-imposes.,Technique
T1499.002,Service Exhaustion Flood,"adversaries may target the different network services provided by systems to conduct a denial of service (dos). adversaries often target the availability of dns and web services, however others have been targeted as well. web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.",Technique
T1499.003,Application Exhaustion Flood,"adversaries may target resource intensive features of applications to cause a denial of service (dos), denying availability to those applications. for example, specific features in web applications may be highly resource intensive. repeated requests to those features may be able to exhaust system resources and deny access to the application or the server itself.",Technique
T1499.004,Application or System Exploitation,"adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities that can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users. some systems may automatically restart critical applications and services when crashes occur, but they can likely be re-exploited to cause a persistent denial of service (dos) condition.",Technique
T1611,Escape to Host,"adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host. this can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the host level or to the host itself. in principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment.",Technique
T1585,Establish Accounts,"adversaries may create and cultivate accounts with services that can be used during targeting. adversaries can create accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations. persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations. this development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity.",Technique
T1585.001,Social Media Accounts,"adversaries may create and cultivate social media accounts that can be used during targeting. adversaries can create social media accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations. persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations.",Technique
T1585.002,Email Accounts,"adversaries may create email accounts that can be used during targeting. adversaries can use accounts created with email providers to further their operations, such as leveraging them to conduct phishing for information or phishing. establishing email accounts may also allow adversaries to abuse free services – such as trial periods – to acquire infrastructure for follow-on purposes.",Technique
T1585.003,Cloud Accounts,"adversaries may create accounts with cloud providers that can be used during targeting. adversaries can use cloud accounts to further their operations, including leveraging cloud storage services such as dropbox, mega, microsoft onedrive, or aws s3 buckets for exfiltration to cloud storage or to upload tools. cloud accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure, such as virtual private servers or serverless infrastructure. establishing cloud accounts may allow adversaries to develop sophisticated capabilities without managing their own servers.",Technique
T1546,Event Triggered Execution,adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries. cloud environments may also support various functions and services that monitor and can be invoked in response to specific cloud events.,Technique
T1546.001,Change Default File Association,"adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by a file type association. when a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called the file association or handler) is checked. file association selections are stored in the windows registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have registry access or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility. applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.",Technique
T1546.002,Screensaver,"adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of portable executable (pe) files with a .scr file extension. the windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in c:\windows\system32\, and c:\windows\syswow64\ on 64-bit windows systems, along with screensavers included with base windows installations.",Technique
T1546.003,Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription,"adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by a windows management instrumentation (wmi) event subscription. wmi can be used to install event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs. examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time, user login, or the computer's uptime.",Technique
T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell. user unix shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. for example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via ssh) a login shell is initiated. the login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc) and the user’s home directory (~/) to configure the environment. all login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. these configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. when the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.",Technique
T1546.005,Trap,adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal. the trap command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals. a common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like ctrl+c and ctrl+d.,Technique
T1546.006,LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition,adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries. mach-o binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded. the lc_load_dylib header in a mach-o binary tells macos and os x which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time. these can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies. there are tools available to perform these changes.,Technique
T1546.007,Netsh Helper DLL,adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by netsh helper dlls. netsh.exe (also referred to as netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. it contains functionality to add helper dlls for extending functionality of the utility. the paths to registered netsh.exe helper dlls are entered into the windows registry at hklm\software\microsoft\netsh.,Technique
T1546.008,Accessibility Features,adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features. windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the windows logon screen). an adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.,Technique
T1546.009,AppCert DLLs,"adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by appcert dlls loaded into processes. dynamic-link libraries (dlls) that are specified in the appcertdlls registry key under hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\control\session manager\ are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously used application programming interface (api) functions createprocess, createprocessasuser  , createprocesswithloginw, createprocesswithtokenw, or winexec.",Technique
T1546.010,AppInit DLLs,"adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by appinit dlls loaded into processes. dynamic-link libraries (dlls) that are specified in the appinit_dlls value in the registry keys hkey_local_machine\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\windows or hkey_local_machine\software\wow6432node\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\windows are loaded by user32.dll into every process that loads user32.dll. in practice this is nearly every program, since user32.dll is a very common library.",Technique
T1546.011,Application Shimming,"adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims. the microsoft windows application compatibility infrastructure/framework (application shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time. for example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code) that were created for windows xp so that it will work with windows 10.",Technique
T1546.012,Image File Execution Options Injection,"adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by image file execution options (ifeo) debuggers. ifeos enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. when a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s ifeo will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., c:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g notepad.exe).",Technique
T1546.013,PowerShell Profile,adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by powershell profiles. a powershell profile (profile.ps1) is a script that runs when powershell starts and can be used as a logon script to customize user environments.,Technique
T1546.014,Emond,"adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the event monitor daemon (emond). emond is a launch daemon that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action. the emond binary at /sbin/emond will load any rules from the /etc/emond.d/rules/ directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.",Technique
T1546.015,Component Object Model Hijacking,adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to component object model (com) objects. com is a system within windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system. references to various com objects are stored in the registry.,Technique
T1546.016,Installer Packages,"adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content. installer packages are os specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed. developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.",Technique
T1546.017,Udev Rules,"adversaries may maintain persistence through executing malicious content triggered using udev rules. udev is the linux kernel device manager that dynamically manages device nodes, handles access to pseudo-device files in the /dev directory, and responds to hardware events, such as when external devices like hard drives or keyboards are plugged in or removed. udev uses rule files with match keys to specify the conditions a hardware event must meet and action keys to define the actions that should follow. root permissions are required to create, modify, or delete rule files located in /etc/udev/rules.d/, /run/udev/rules.d/, /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/, /usr/local/lib/udev/rules.d/, and /lib/udev/rules.d/. rule priority is determined by both directory and by the digit prefix in the rule filename.",Technique
T1480,Execution Guardrails,"adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign. values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined active directory (ad) domains, and local/external ip addresses.",Technique
T1480.001,Environmental Keying,adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment. environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. environmental keying is an implementation of execution guardrails that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.,Technique
T1480.002,Mutual Exclusion,adversaries may constrain execution or actions based on the presence of a mutex associated with malware. a mutex is a locking mechanism used to synchronize access to a resource. only one thread or process can acquire a mutex at a given time.,Technique
T1048,Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol,adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a different protocol than that of the existing command and control channel. the data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.,Technique
T1048.001,Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a symmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. the data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.,Technique
T1048.002,Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an asymmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. the data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.,Technique
T1048.003,Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol,adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an un-encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. the data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.,Technique
T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load dlls. windows systems use a common method to look for required dlls to load into a program. hijacking dll loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.,Technique
T1574.002,DLL Side-Loading,"adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading dlls. similar to dll search order hijacking, side-loading involves hijacking which dll a program loads. but rather than just planting the dll within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).",Technique
T1574.004,Dylib Hijacking,"adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. the dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. paths to dylibs may be prefixed with @rpath, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable. additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the lc_load_weak_dylib function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macos versions as new apis are added.",Technique
T1574.005,Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,"adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. these processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. if the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. if the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include system.",Technique
T1574.006,Dynamic Linker Hijacking,"adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. during the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as ld_preload on linux or dyld_insert_libraries on macos. libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name. these variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library.",Technique
T1574.007,Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries. the path environment variable contains a list of directories (user  and system) that the os searches sequentially through in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command line.,Technique
T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.",Technique
T1574.009,Path Interception by Unquoted Path,"adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references. adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.",Technique
T1574.010,Services File Permissions Weakness,"adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services. adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start. these service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. if the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. if the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include system.",Technique
T1574.011,Services Registry Permissions Weakness,"adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the registry entries used by services. adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for registry keys related to services to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code when a service starts. windows stores local service configuration information in the registry under hklm\system\currentcontrolset\services. the information stored under a service's registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe, powershell, or reg. access to registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions.",Technique
T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,"adversaries may leverage the cor_profiler environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .net clr. the cor_profiler is a .net framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .net) profiling dll to be loaded into each .net process that loads the common language runtime (clr). these profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .net clr.",Technique
T1574.013,KernelCallbackTable,adversaries may abuse the kernelcallbacktable of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads. the kernelcallbacktable can be found in the process environment block (peb) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a gui process once user32.dll is loaded.,Technique
T1574.014,AppDomainManager,adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking how the .net appdomainmanager loads assemblies. the .net framework uses the appdomainmanager class to create and manage one or more isolated runtime environments (called application domains) inside a process to host the execution of .net applications. assemblies (.exe or .dll binaries compiled to run as .net code) may be loaded into an application domain as executable code.,Technique
T1562,Impair Defenses,"adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms. this not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior. this may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users and administrators.",Technique
T1562.001,Disable or Modify Tools,"adversaries may modify and/or disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their malware/tools and activities. this may take many forms, such as killing security software processes or services, modifying / deleting registry keys or configuration files so that tools do not operate properly, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information. adversaries may also disable updates to prevent the latest security patches from reaching tools on victim systems.",Technique
T1562.002,Disable Windows Event Logging,"adversaries may disable windows event logging to limit data that can be leveraged for detections and audits. windows event logs record user and system activity such as login attempts, process creation, and much more. this data is used by security tools and analysts to generate detections.",Technique
T1562.003,Impair Command History Logging,adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system. various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.,Technique
T1562.004,Disable or Modify System Firewall,"adversaries may disable or modify system firewalls in order to bypass controls limiting network usage. changes could be disabling the entire mechanism as well as adding, deleting, or modifying particular rules. this can be done numerous ways depending on the operating system, including via command-line, editing windows registry keys, and windows control panel.",Technique
T1562.006,Indicator Blocking,"an adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed. this could include maliciously redirecting or even disabling host-based sensors, such as event tracing for windows (etw), by tampering settings that control the collection and flow of event telemetry. these settings may be stored on the system in configuration files and/or in the registry as well as being accessible via administrative utilities such as powershell or windows management instrumentation.",Technique
T1562.007,Disable or Modify Cloud Firewall,adversaries may disable or modify a firewall within a cloud environment to bypass controls that limit access to cloud resources. cloud firewalls are separate from system firewalls that are described in disable or modify system firewall.,Technique
T1562.008,Disable or Modify Cloud Logs,"an adversary may disable or modify cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid detection. cloud environments allow for collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a user does within the environment. if an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable or modify logging to avoid detection of their activities.",Technique
T1562.009,Safe Mode Boot,adversaries may abuse windows safe mode to disable endpoint defenses. safe mode starts up the windows operating system with a limited set of drivers and services. third-party security software such as endpoint detection and response (edr) tools may not start after booting windows in safe mode. there are two versions of safe mode: safe mode and safe mode with networking. it is possible to start additional services after a safe mode boot.,Technique
T1562.010,Downgrade Attack,"adversaries may downgrade or use a version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls. downgrade attacks typically take advantage of a system’s backward compatibility to force it into less secure modes of operation.",Technique
T1562.011,Spoof Security Alerting,"adversaries may spoof security alerting from tools, presenting false evidence to impair defenders’ awareness of malicious activity. messages produced by defensive tools contain information about potential security events as well as the functioning status of security software and the system. security reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system and identifying important events that can signal a security incident.",Technique
T1562.012,Disable or Modify Linux Audit System,"adversaries may disable or modify the linux audit system to hide malicious activity and avoid detection. linux admins use the linux audit system to track security-relevant information on a system. the linux audit system operates at the kernel-level and maintains event logs on application and system activity such as process, network, file, and login events based on pre-configured rules.",Technique
T1656,Impersonation,"adversaries may impersonate a trusted person or organization in order to persuade and trick a target into performing some action on their behalf. for example, adversaries may communicate with victims (via phishing for information, phishing, or internal spearphishing) while impersonating a known sender such as an executive, colleague, or third-party vendor. established trust can then be leveraged to accomplish an adversary’s ultimate goals, possibly against multiple victims.",Technique
T1525,Implant Internal Image,"adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish persistence after gaining access to an environment. amazon web services (aws) amazon machine images (amis), google cloud platform (gcp) images, and azure images as well as popular container runtimes such as docker can be implanted or backdoored. unlike upload malware, this technique focuses on adversaries implanting an image in a registry within a victim’s environment. depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest image.",Technique
T1070,Indicator Removal,"adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove evidence of their presence or hinder defenses. various artifacts may be created by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversary’s actions. typically these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events, such as strings from downloaded files, logs that are generated from user actions, and other data analyzed by defenders. location, format, and type of artifact (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform.",Technique
T1070.001,Clear Windows Event Logs,"adversaries may clear windows event logs to hide the activity of an intrusion. windows event logs are a record of a computer's alerts and notifications. there are three system-defined sources of events: system, application, and security, with five event types: error, warning, information, success audit, and failure audit.",Technique
T1070.002,Clear Linux or Mac System Logs,"adversaries may clear system logs to hide evidence of an intrusion. macos and linux both keep track of system or user-initiated actions via system logs. the majority of native system logging is stored under the /var/log/ directory. subfolders in this directory categorize logs by their related functions, such as:",Technique
T1070.003,Clear Command History,"in addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the command history of a compromised account to conceal the actions undertaken during an intrusion. various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.",Technique
T1070.004,File Deletion,"adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion activity. malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary (ex: ingress tool transfer) may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how. removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's footprint.",Technique
T1070.005,Network Share Connection Removal,adversaries may remove share connections that are no longer useful in order to clean up traces of their operation. windows shared drive and smb/windows admin shares connections can be removed when no longer needed. net is an example utility that can be used to remove network share connections with the net use \system\share /delete command.,Technique
T1070.006,Timestomp,"adversaries may modify file time attributes to hide new files or changes to existing files. timestomping is a technique that modifies the timestamps of a file (the modify, access, create, and change times), often to mimic files that are in the same folder and blend malicious files with legitimate files.",Technique
T1070.007,Clear Network Connection History and Configurations,"adversaries may clear or remove evidence of malicious network connections in order to clean up traces of their operations. configuration settings as well as various artifacts that highlight connection history may be created on a system and/or in application logs from behaviors that require network connections, such as remote services or external remote services. defenders may use these artifacts to monitor or otherwise analyze network connections created by adversaries.",Technique
T1070.008,Clear Mailbox Data,"adversaries may modify mail and mail application data to remove evidence of their activity. email applications allow users and other programs to export and delete mailbox data via command line tools or use of apis. mail application data can be emails, email metadata, or logs generated by the application or operating system, such as export requests.",Technique
T1070.009,Clear Persistence,"adversaries may clear artifacts associated with previously established persistence on a host system to remove evidence of their activity. this may involve various actions, such as removing services, deleting executables, modify registry, plist file modification, or other methods of cleanup to prevent defenders from collecting evidence of their persistent presence. adversaries may also delete accounts previously created to maintain persistence (i.e. create account).",Technique
T1070.010,Relocate Malware,"once a payload is delivered, adversaries may reproduce copies of the same malware on the victim system to remove evidence of their presence and/or avoid defenses. copying malware payloads to new locations may also be combined with file deletion to cleanup older artifacts.",Technique
T1202,Indirect Command Execution,"adversaries may abuse utilities that allow for command execution to bypass security restrictions that limit the use of command-line interpreters. various windows utilities may be used to execute commands, possibly without invoking cmd. for example, forfiles, the program compatibility assistant (pcalua.exe), components of the windows subsystem for linux (wsl), scriptrunner.exe, as well as other utilities may invoke the execution of programs and commands from a command and scripting interpreter, run window, or via scripts.",Technique
T1105,Ingress Tool Transfer,"adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment. tools or files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system to the victim network through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols such as ftp. once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. lateral tool transfer).",Technique
T1490,Inhibit System Recovery,adversaries may delete or remove built-in data and turn off services designed to aid in the recovery of a corrupted system to prevent recovery. this may deny access to available backups and recovery options.,Technique
T1056,Input Capture,"adversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect information. during normal system usage, users often provide credentials to various different locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. credential api hooking) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine service (e.g. web portal capture).",Technique
T1056.001,Keylogging,"adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials as the user types them. keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when os credential dumping efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to intercept keystrokes on a system for a substantial period of time before credentials can be successfully captured. in order to increase the likelihood of capturing credentials quickly, an adversary may also perform actions such as clearing browser cookies to force users to reauthenticate to systems.",Technique
T1056.002,GUI Input Capture,"adversaries may mimic common operating system gui components to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt. when programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task (ex: bypass user account control).",Technique
T1056.003,Web Portal Capture,"adversaries may install code on externally facing portals, such as a vpn login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. for example, a compromised login page may log provided user credentials before logging the user in to the service.",Technique
T1056.004,Credential API Hooking,"adversaries may hook into windows application programming interface (api) functions to collect user credentials. malicious hooking mechanisms may capture api calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials. unlike keylogging, this technique focuses specifically on api functions that include parameters that reveal user credentials. hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:",Technique
T1559,Inter-Process Communication,"adversaries may abuse inter-process communication (ipc) mechanisms for local code or command execution. ipc is typically used by processes to share data, communicate with each other, or synchronize execution. ipc is also commonly used to avoid situations such as deadlocks, which occurs when processes are stuck in a cyclic waiting pattern.",Technique
T1559.001,Component Object Model,"adversaries may use the windows component object model (com) for local code execution. com is an inter-process communication (ipc) component of the native windows application programming interface (api) that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces. through com, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically binary dynamic link libraries (dll) or executables (exe). remote com execution is facilitated by remote services such as distributed component object model (dcom).",Technique
T1559.002,Dynamic Data Exchange,"adversaries may use windows dynamic data exchange (dde) to execute arbitrary commands. dde is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (ipc) between applications. once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.",Technique
T1559.003,XPC Services,"adversaries can provide malicious content to an xpc service daemon for local code execution. macos uses xpc services for basic inter-process communication between various processes, such as between the xpc service daemon and third-party application privileged helper tools. applications can send messages to the xpc service daemon, which runs as root, using the low-level xpc service c api or the high level nsxpcconnection api in order to handle tasks that require elevated privileges (such as network connections). applications are responsible for providing the protocol definition which serves as a blueprint of the xpc services. developers typically use xpc services to provide applications stability and privilege separation between the application client and the daemon.",Technique
T1534,Internal Spearphishing,"after they already have access to accounts or systems within the environment, adversaries may use internal spearphishing to gain access to additional information or compromise other users within the same organization. internal spearphishing is multi-staged campaign where a legitimate account is initially compromised either by controlling the user's device or by compromising the account credentials of the user. adversaries may then attempt to take advantage of the trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking more victims into falling for phish attempts, often incorporating impersonation.",Technique
T1570,Lateral Tool Transfer,"adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems in a compromised environment. once brought into the victim environment (i.e., ingress tool transfer) files may then be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation.",Technique
T1654,Log Enumeration,"adversaries may enumerate system and service logs to find useful data. these logs may highlight various types of valuable insights for an adversary, such as user authentication records (account discovery), security or vulnerable software (software discovery), or hosts within a compromised network (remote system discovery).",Technique
T1036,Masquerading,"adversaries may attempt to manipulate features of their artifacts to make them appear legitimate or benign to users and/or security tools. masquerading occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. this may include manipulating file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate task or service names.",Technique
T1036.001,Invalid Code Signature,"adversaries may attempt to mimic features of valid code signatures to increase the chance of deceiving a user, analyst, or tool. code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. adversaries can copy the metadata and signature information from a signed program, then use it as a template for an unsigned program. files with invalid code signatures will fail digital signature validation checks, but they may appear more legitimate to users and security tools may improperly handle these files.",Technique
T1036.002,Right-to-Left Override,"adversaries may abuse the right-to-left override (rtlo or rlo) character (u+202e) to disguise a string and/or file name to make it appear benign. rtlo is a non-printing unicode character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse. for example, a windows screensaver executable named march 25 \u202excod.scr will display as march 25 rcs.docx. a javascript file named photo_high_re\u202egnp.js will be displayed as photo_high_resj.png.",Technique
T1036.003,Rename System Utilities,adversaries may rename legitimate system utilities to try to evade security mechanisms concerning the usage of those utilities. security monitoring and control mechanisms may be in place for system utilities adversaries are capable of abusing. it may be possible to bypass those security mechanisms by renaming the utility prior to utilization (ex: rename rundll32.exe). an alternative case occurs when a legitimate utility is copied or moved to a different directory and renamed to avoid detections based on system utilities executing from non-standard paths.,Technique
T1036.004,Masquerade Task or Service,adversaries may attempt to manipulate the name of a task or service to make it appear legitimate or benign. tasks/services executed by the task scheduler or systemd will typically be given a name and/or description. windows services will have a service name as well as a display name. many benign tasks and services exist that have commonly associated names. adversaries may give tasks or services names that are similar or identical to those of legitimate ones.,Technique
T1036.005,Match Legitimate Name or Location,"adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming/placing them. this is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. this may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under system32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: svchost.exe). in containerized environments, this may also be done by creating a resource in a namespace that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster. alternatively, a file or container image name given may be a close approximation to legitimate programs/images or something innocuous.",Technique
T1036.006,Space after Filename,"adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of a file. with certain file types (specifically this does not work with .app extensions), appending a space to the end of a filename will change how the file is processed by the operating system.",Technique
T1036.007,Double File Extension,"adversaries may abuse a double extension in the filename as a means of masquerading the true file type. a file name may include a secondary file type extension that may cause only the first extension to be displayed (ex: file.txt.exe may render in some views as just file.txt). however, the second extension is the true file type that determines how the file is opened and executed. the real file extension may be hidden by the operating system in the file browser (ex: explorer.exe), as well as in any software configured using or similar to the system’s policies.",Technique
T1036.008,Masquerade File Type,"adversaries may masquerade malicious payloads as legitimate files through changes to the payload's formatting, including the file’s signature, extension, and contents. various file types have a typical standard format, including how they are encoded and organized. for example, a file’s signature (also known as header or magic bytes) is the beginning bytes of a file and is often used to identify the file’s type. for example, the header of a jpeg file, is 0xff 0xd8 and the file extension is either .jpe, .jpeg or .jpg.",Technique
T1036.009,Break Process Trees,"an adversary may attempt to evade process tree-based analysis by modifying executed malware's parent process id (ppid). if endpoint protection software leverages the 'parent-child' relationship for detection, breaking this relationship could result in the adversary’s behavior not being associated with previous process tree activity. on unix-based systems breaking this process tree is common practice for administrators to execute software using scripts and programs.",Technique
T1036.010,Masquerade Account Name,"adversaries may match or approximate the names of legitimate accounts to make newly created ones appear benign. this will typically occur during create account, although accounts may also be renamed at a later date. this may also coincide with account access removal if the actor first deletes an account before re-creating one with the same name.",Technique
T1556,Modify Authentication Process,"adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. the authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the local security authentication server (lsass) process and the security accounts manager (sam) on windows, pluggable authentication modules (pam) on unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on macos systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. by modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using valid accounts.",Technique
T1556.001,Domain Controller Authentication,adversaries may patch the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to accounts.,Technique
T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries (dlls) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.,Technique
T1556.003,Pluggable Authentication Modules,"adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (pam) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. pam is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services. the most common authentication module is pam_unix.so, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.",Technique
T1556.004,Network Device Authentication,"adversaries may use patch system image to hard code a password in the operating system, thus bypassing of native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices.",Technique
T1556.005,Reversible Encryption,an adversary may abuse active directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on windows systems. the allowreversiblepasswordencryption property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. by default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.,Technique
T1556.006,Multi-Factor Authentication,adversaries may disable or modify multi-factor authentication (mfa) mechanisms to enable persistent access to compromised accounts.,Technique
T1556.007,Hybrid Identity,"adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent access to accounts.",Technique
T1556.008,Network Provider DLL,"adversaries may register malicious network provider dynamic link libraries (dlls) to capture cleartext user credentials during the authentication process. network provider dlls allow windows to interface with specific network protocols and can also support add-on credential management functions. during the logon process, winlogon (the interactive logon module) sends credentials to the local mpnotify.exe process via rpc. the mpnotify.exe process then shares the credentials in cleartext with registered credential managers when notifying that a logon event is happening.",Technique
T1556.009,Conditional Access Policies,adversaries may disable or modify conditional access policies to enable persistent access to compromised accounts. conditional access policies are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to a resource.,Technique
T1578,Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure,"an adversary may attempt to modify a cloud account's compute service infrastructure to evade defenses. a modification to the compute service infrastructure can include the creation, deletion, or modification of one or more components such as compute instances, virtual machines, and snapshots.",Technique
T1578.001,Create Snapshot,"an adversary may create a snapshot or data backup within a cloud account to evade defenses. a snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an existing cloud compute component such as a virtual machine (vm), virtual hard drive, or volume. an adversary may leverage permissions to create a snapshot in order to bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing compute service infrastructure, unlike in revert cloud instance where an adversary may revert to a snapshot to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.",Technique
T1578.002,Create Cloud Instance,"an adversary may create a new instance or virtual machine (vm) within the compute service of a cloud account to evade defenses. creating a new instance may allow an adversary to bypass firewall rules and permissions that exist on instances currently residing within an account. an adversary may create snapshot of one or more volumes in an account, create a new instance, mount the snapshots, and then apply a less restrictive security policy to collect data from local system or for remote data staging.",Technique
T1578.003,Delete Cloud Instance,an adversary may delete a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in an attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence. deleting an instance or virtual machine can remove valuable forensic artifacts and other evidence of suspicious behavior if the instance is not recoverable.,Technique
T1578.004,Revert Cloud Instance,"an adversary may revert changes made to a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence. in highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be accomplished by restoring virtual machine (vm) or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard or cloud apis.",Technique
T1578.005,Modify Cloud Compute Configurations,"adversaries may modify settings that directly affect the size, locations, and resources available to cloud compute infrastructure in order to evade defenses. these settings may include service quotas, subscription associations, tenant-wide policies, or other configurations that impact available compute. such modifications may allow adversaries to abuse the victim’s compute resources to achieve their goals, potentially without affecting the execution of running instances and/or revealing their activities to the victim.",Technique
T1666,Modify Cloud Resource Hierarchy,adversaries may attempt to modify hierarchical structures in infrastructure-as-a-service (iaas) environments in order to evade defenses.,Technique
T1112,Modify Registry,"adversaries may interact with the windows registry to hide configuration information within registry keys, remove information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in persistence and execution.",Technique
T1601,Modify System Image,"adversaries may make changes to the operating system of embedded network devices to weaken defenses and provide new capabilities for themselves. on such devices, the operating systems are typically monolithic and most of the device functionality and capabilities are contained within a single file.",Technique
T1601.001,Patch System Image,"adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses. some network devices are built with a monolithic architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality of the device is contained within a single file. adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.",Technique
T1601.002,Downgrade System Image,"adversaries may install an older version of the operating system of a network device to weaken security. older operating system versions on network devices often have weaker encryption ciphers and, in general, fewer/less updated defensive features.",Technique
T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,"adversaries may target multi-factor authentication (mfa) mechanisms, (i.e., smart cards, token generators, etc.) to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources. use of mfa is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms.",Technique
T1621,Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation,adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (mfa) mechanisms and gain access to accounts by generating mfa requests sent to users.,Technique
T1104,Multi-Stage Channels,adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are employed under different conditions or for certain functions. use of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.,Technique
T1106,Native API,"adversaries may interact with the native os application programming interface (api) to execute behaviors. native apis provide a controlled means of calling low-level os services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes. these native apis are leveraged by the os during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.",Technique
T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices responsible for network segmentation. breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.,Technique
T1599.001,Network Address Translation Traversal,adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network device’s network address translation (nat) configuration. malicious modifications to nat may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.,Technique
T1498,Network Denial of Service,"adversaries may perform network denial of service (dos) attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users. network dos can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. example resources include specific websites, email services, dns, and web-based applications. adversaries have been observed conducting network dos attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.",Technique
T1498.001,Direct Network Flood,adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (dos) by directly sending a high-volume of network traffic to a target. this dos attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network. direct network floods are when one or more systems are used to send a high-volume of network packets towards the targeted service's network. almost any network protocol may be used for flooding. stateless protocols such as udp or icmp are commonly used but stateful protocols such as tcp can be used as well.,Technique
T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,"adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (dos) by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target. this type of network dos takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source ip address. this third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. an adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. similar to direct network floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target. this network dos attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.",Technique
T1046,Network Service Discovery,"adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts and local network infrastructure devices, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. common methods to acquire this information include port and/or vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system.",Technique
T1135,Network Share Discovery,adversaries may look for folders and drives shared on remote systems as a means of identifying sources of information to gather as a precursor for collection and to identify potential systems of interest for lateral movement. networks often contain shared network drives and folders that enable users to access file directories on various systems across a network.,Technique
T1040,Network Sniffing,"adversaries may passively sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network. network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. an adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.",Technique
T1095,Non-Application Layer Protocol,"adversaries may use an osi non-application layer protocol for communication between host and c2 server or among infected hosts within a network. the list of possible protocols is extensive. specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the internet control message protocol (icmp), transport layer protocols, such as the user datagram protocol (udp), session layer protocols, such as socket secure (socks), as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as serial over lan (sol).",Technique
T1571,Non-Standard Port,"adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port pairing that are typically not associated. for example, https over port 8088 or port 587 as opposed to the traditional port 443. adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.",Technique
T1027,Obfuscated Files or Information,"adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. this is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.",Technique
T1027.001,Binary Padding,"adversaries may use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware. this can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations.",Technique
T1027.002,Software Packing,adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code. software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory. virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. a virtual machine is then called to run this code.,Technique
T1027.003,Steganography,"adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information. steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.",Technique
T1027.004,Compile After Delivery,"adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to discover and analyze by delivering files to victims as uncompiled code. text-based source code files may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries. these payloads will need to be compiled before execution; typically via native utilities such as ilasm.exe, csc.exe, or gcc/mingw.",Technique
T1027.005,Indicator Removal from Tools,"adversaries may remove indicators from tools if they believe their malicious tool was detected, quarantined, or otherwise curtailed. they can modify the tool by removing the indicator and using the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.",Technique
T1027.006,HTML Smuggling,"adversaries may smuggle data and files past content filters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign html files. html documents can store large binary objects known as javascript blobs (immutable data that represents raw bytes) that can later be constructed into file-like objects. data may also be stored in data urls, which enable embedding media type or mime files inline of html documents. html5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate file downloads.",Technique
T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,"adversaries may obfuscate then dynamically resolve api functions called by their malware in order to conceal malicious functionalities and impair defensive analysis. malware commonly uses various native api functions provided by the os to perform various tasks such as those involving processes, files, and other system artifacts.",Technique
T1027.008,Stripped Payloads,"adversaries may attempt to make a payload difficult to analyze by removing symbols, strings, and other human readable information. scripts and executables may contain variables names and other strings that help developers document code functionality. symbols are often created by an operating system’s linker when executable payloads are compiled. reverse engineers use these symbols and strings to analyze code and to identify functionality in payloads.",Technique
T1027.009,Embedded Payloads,"adversaries may embed payloads within other files to conceal malicious content from defenses. otherwise seemingly benign files (such as scripts and executables) may be abused to carry and obfuscate malicious payloads and content. in some cases, embedded payloads may also enable adversaries to subvert trust controls by not impacting execution controls such as digital signatures and notarization tickets.",Technique
T1027.010,Command Obfuscation,"adversaries may obfuscate content during command execution to impede detection. command-line obfuscation is a method of making strings and patterns within commands and scripts more difficult to signature and analyze. this type of obfuscation can be included within commands executed by delivered payloads (e.g., phishing and drive-by compromise) or interactively via command and scripting interpreter.",Technique
T1027.011,Fileless Storage,"adversaries may store data in 'fileless' formats to conceal malicious activity from defenses. fileless storage can be broadly defined as any format other than a file. common examples of non-volatile fileless storage in windows systems include the windows registry, event logs, or wmi repository. in linux systems, shared memory directories such as /dev/shm, /run/shm, /var/run, and /var/lock may also be considered fileless storage, as files written to these directories are mapped directly to ram and not stored on the disk.",Technique

T1216.001,PubPrn,"adversaries may use pubprn to proxy execution of malicious remote files. pubprn.vbs is a visual basic script that publishes a printer to active directory domain services. the script may be signed by microsoft and is commonly executed through the windows command shell via cscript.exe. for example, the following code publishes a printer within the specified domain: cscript pubprn printer1 ldap://cn=container1,dc=domain1,dc=com.",Technique
T1216.002,SyncAppvPublishingServer,"adversaries may abuse syncappvpublishingserver.vbs to proxy execution of malicious powershell commands. syncappvpublishingserver.vbs is a visual basic script associated with how windows virtualizes applications (microsoft application virtualization, or app-v). for example, windows may render win32 applications to users as virtual applications, allowing users to launch and interact with them as if they were installed locally.",Technique
T1007,System Service Discovery,"adversaries may try to gather information about registered local system services. adversaries may obtain information about services using tools as well as os utility commands such as sc query, tasklist /svc, systemctl --type=service, and net start.",Technique
T1569,System Services,"adversaries may abuse system services or daemons to execute commands or programs. adversaries can execute malicious content by interacting with or creating services either locally or remotely. many services are set to run at boot, which can aid in achieving persistence (create or modify system process), but adversaries can also abuse services for one-time or temporary execution.",Technique
T1569.001,Launchctl,"adversaries may abuse launchctl to execute commands or programs. launchctl interfaces with launchd, the service management framework for macos. launchctl supports taking subcommands on the command-line, interactively, or even redirected from standard input.",Technique
T1569.002,Service Execution,adversaries may abuse the windows service control manager to execute malicious commands or payloads. the windows service control manager (services.exe) is an interface to manage and manipulate services. the service control manager is accessible to users via gui components as well as system utilities such as sc.exe and net.,Technique
T1529,System Shutdown/Reboot,"adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems. operating systems may contain commands to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a machine or network device. in some cases, these commands may also be used to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a remote computer or network device via network device cli (e.g. reload).",Technique
T1124,System Time Discovery,"an adversary may gather the system time and/or time zone settings from a local or remote system. the system time is set and stored by services, such as the windows time service on windows or systemsetup on macos. these time settings may also be synchronized between systems and services in an enterprise network, typically accomplished with a network time server within a domain.",Technique
T1080,Taint Shared Content,"adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories. content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.",Technique
T1221,Template Injection,"adversaries may create or modify references in user document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts. for example, microsoft’s office open xml (ooxml) specification defines an xml-based format for office documents (.docx, xlsx, .pptx) to replace older binary formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt). ooxml files are packed together zip archives compromised of various xml files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered.",Technique
T1205,Traffic Signaling,"adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. this may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. port knocking), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. after the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.",Technique
T1205.001,Port Knocking,"adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control. to enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports. after the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.",Technique
T1205.002,Socket Filters,"adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. with elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the libpcap library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. the filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). when the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.",Technique
T1537,Transfer Data to Cloud Account,"adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including through sharing/syncing and creating backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service.",Technique
T1127,Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution,"adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy execution of malicious payloads. there are many utilities used for software development related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development, debugging, and reverse engineering. these utilities may often be signed with legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.",Technique
T1127.001,MSBuild,adversaries may use msbuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted windows utility. msbuild.exe (microsoft build engine) is a software build platform used by visual studio. it handles xml formatted project files that define requirements for loading and building various platforms and configurations.,Technique
T1127.002,ClickOnce,"adversaries may use clickonce applications (.appref-ms and .application files) to proxy execution of code through a trusted windows utility. clickonce is a deployment that enables a user to create self-updating windows-based .net applications (i.e, .xbap, .exe, or .dll) that install and run from a file share or web page with minimal user interaction. the application launches as a child process of dfsvc.exe, which is responsible for installing, launching, and updating the application.",Technique
T1199,Trusted Relationship,adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. access through trusted third party relationship abuses an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.,Technique
T1552,Unsecured Credentials,"adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials. these credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files (e.g. bash history), operating system or application-specific repositories (e.g. credentials in registry), or other specialized files/artifacts (e.g. private keys).",Technique
T1552.001,Credentials In Files,"adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing insecurely stored credentials. these can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.",Technique
T1552.002,Credentials in Registry,adversaries may search the registry on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. the windows registry stores configuration information that can be used by the system or other programs. adversaries may query the registry looking for credentials and passwords that have been stored for use by other programs or services. sometimes these credentials are used for automatic logons.,Technique
T1552.003,Bash History,"adversaries may search the bash command history on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the 'history' utility. once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s .bash_history file. for each user, this file resides at the same location: ~/.bash_history. typically, this file keeps track of the user’s last 500 commands. users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out. adversaries can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials.",Technique
T1552.004,Private Keys,"adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures. common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc.",Technique

T1552.007,Container API,"adversaries may gather credentials via apis within a containers environment. apis in these environments, such as the docker api and kubernetes apis, allow a user to remotely manage their container resources and cluster components.",Technique
T1552.008,Chat Messages,"adversaries may directly collect unsecured credentials stored or passed through user communication services. credentials may be sent and stored in user chat communication applications such as email, chat services like slack or teams, collaboration tools like jira or trello, and any other services that support user communication. users may share various forms of credentials (such as usernames and passwords, api keys, or authentication tokens) on private or public corporate internal communications channels.",Technique
T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection. access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.,Technique
T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,"adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.",Technique
T1550.001,Application Access Token,"adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. these tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.",Technique
T1550.002,Pass the Hash,"adversaries may 'pass the hash' using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. pass the hash (pth) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. this method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.",Technique
T1550.003,Pass the Ticket,"adversaries may 'pass the ticket' using stolen kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. pass the ticket (ptt) is a method of authenticating to a system using kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password. kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.",Technique
T1550.004,Web Session Cookie,adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services. this technique bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.,Technique
T1204,User  Execution,"an adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link. these user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of phishing.",Technique
T1204.001,Malicious Link,an adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to gain execution. users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to click on a link that will lead to code execution. this user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from spearphishing link. clicking on a link may also lead to other execution techniques such as exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via exploitation for client execution. links may also lead users to download files that require execution via malicious file.,Technique
T1204.002,Malicious File,"an adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution. users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code execution. this user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from spearphishing attachment. adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, .cpl, and .reg.",Technique
T1204.003,Malicious Image,"adversaries may rely on a user running a malicious image to facilitate execution. amazon web services (aws) amazon machine images (amis), google cloud platform (gcp) images, and azure images as well as popular container runtimes such as docker can be backdoored. backdoored images may be uploaded to a public repository via upload malware, and users may then download and deploy an instance or container from the image without realizing the image is malicious, thus bypassing techniques that specifically achieve initial access. this can lead to the execution of malicious code, such as code that executes cryptocurrency mining, in the instance or container.",Technique
T1078,Valid Accounts,"adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion. compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as vpns, outlook web access, network devices, and remote desktop. compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.",Technique
T1078.001,Default Accounts,"adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion. default accounts are those that are built-into an os, such as the guest or administrator accounts on windows systems. default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in aws and the default service account in kubernetes.",Technique
T1078.002,Domain Accounts,"adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a domain account as a means of gaining initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion. domain accounts are those managed by active directory domain services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. domain accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.",Technique
T1078.003,Local Accounts,"adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a local account as a means of gaining initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion. local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.",Technique
T1078.004,Cloud Accounts,"valid accounts in cloud environments may allow adversaries to perform actions to achieve initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion. cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or saas application. cloud accounts can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other identity sources such as windows active directory.",Technique
T1125,Video Capture,"an adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., integrated cameras or webcams) or applications (e.g., video call services) to capture video recordings for the purpose of gathering information. images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.",Technique
T1497,Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,"adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. this may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (vme) or sandbox. if the adversary detects a vme, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. they may also search for vme artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. adversaries may use the information learned from virtualization/sandbox evasion during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.",Technique
T1497.001,System Checks,"adversaries may employ various system checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. this may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (vme) or sandbox. if the adversary detects a vme, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. they may also search for vme artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. adversaries may use the information learned from virtualization/sandbox evasion during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.",Technique
